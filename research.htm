            <p>For the past decade, scientists have been studying
              hydrodynamic systems, specifically walking droplets, that
              exhibit wave particle behavior and some quantum-like
              features.&nbsp; These are generally modeled as quite
              complex integro-differential equations.&nbsp; In recent
              years, mathematicians have developed discrete dynamical
              models for these walking droplets.<br>

              such model, which describes straight line motion of the
              walkers, and developed theorems that verified and even
              extended what had been observed in the past.&nbsp; Our
              analysis will aid in guiding experimentalists to develop
              new experiments that will improve our understanding of
              these systems.<br>

                align="left" width="200">Many biological systems
              including our brains and brains of other animals are
              capable arithmetic or more complicated logical
              operations.&nbsp; In order to understand how biological
              systems become intelligent it is necessary to study
              logical circuits.</p>
            <p><br>
              When one thinks of logical circuits, typically a
              simple-nondynamic electronic circuit comes to mind.&nbsp;
              However, for biological systems the logical behavior isn't
              quite so linear.&nbsp; Thought happens in a more
              nonlinear, perhaps chaotic, manner.&nbsp; In more recent
              years electrical engineers have designed chaotic logical
              circuits, such as the RS flip-flop circuit.&nbsp; We have
              modeled the chaotic dynamics of the threshold voltages of
              this circuit and analyzed these models.&nbsp; We have also
              reproduced the chaotic RS flip-flop circuit and observed
              behavior similar to those of previous experiments.<br>

            <h3>Chaotic scattering:</h3>
            <p>Chaotic scattering has been studied from the early 70s
              and 80s in solitary wave collisions from <br>
              the Phi-Four equation (called Kink-Antikink
              collisions).&nbsp; These were mainly numerical studies
              that gave insight into the phenomena.&nbsp; However, since
              the equation is so difficult to work with there has been
              very little analysis done.&nbsp; In more recent years
              reduction techniques have been used to approximate the
              Phi-Four PDE with a system of ODEs and also as an iterated
              map.<br>
            </p>
            <p>We have gone further and developed a mechanical analog (a
              ball rolling on a special surface) of chaotic scattering
              in Kink-Antikink collisions.&nbsp; This was done in order
              to conduct experiments.&nbsp; In addition to experiments
              we have analyzed the system thoroughly, including the
              dissipation<br>
              that comes from friction.&nbsp; The experimental setup is
              shown bellow.<br>

            <h3>Distribution of metastases:</h3>
            <p>The proper prediction of how metastatic tumors are
              distributed can help save lives.<br>
            </p>
            <p>We used a model from Iwata et. al. (2000) and sought ways
              of simplifying it, improving upon it, and finding
              numerical solutions.&nbsp; We saw that the Iwata model can
              be solved using an upwind scheme.&nbsp; For the new models
              we focused on the effects of drugs on tumors, and
              simplifying the PDE into ODEs.&nbsp; Drug affects was a
              major focus due to the lack of models taking drugs into
              account in the literature.&nbsp; This is difficult to do,
              however, because drugs attack cells
              indiscriminately.&nbsp; Probabilistically it has a bigger
              effect on larger tumors than smaller ones, but it seems as
              though a stochastic model is needed.</p>

            <h3>Alternate proof of Peixoto's theorem in 1-D:</h3>
            <p>Peixoto's theorem is one of the most important theorems
              in Dynamical Systems.&nbsp; It was proved by Dr. Mauricio
              Matos Peixoto in 1962.&nbsp; This proof is extremely
              involved - far too involved for most undergraduate
              students to follow.&nbsp; We develop an alternate -
              pedagogical proof of the simpler 1-D case, with the goal
              of allowing senior undergraduate students to follow and
              understand the proof and consequently some of the ideas
              involved in the much bigger proof of the 2-D case.

            <h3>Particle Accelerator Physics:</h3>
            <p> We numerically simulate the beam dynamics of the Energy
              Recovery Linear Particle Accelerator (ERL) design for
              Argonne National Lab's (ANL) Advanced Photon Source
              (APS).&nbsp; The code BI, created by Ivan Bazarov, is
              benchmarked against our own code for simpler
              Accelerators.&nbsp; Then the full ERL is simulated and the
              results analyzed.&nbsp; We conclude that the ERL, if
              built, would theoretically be stable.&nbsp; Therefore, it
              would be feasible to build it.</p>
